Dear Editor and Reviewers,

We would like to express our sincere gratitude for the time and effort you have dedicated to reviewing our manuscript titled **"METHOD OF UAV-BASED INSPECTION OF PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULES USING THERMAL AND RGB DATA FUSION"**. We greatly appreciate the insightful comments and constructive suggestions provided, which have been instrumental in improving the quality, clarity, and scientific rigor of our work.

We have carefully considered each remark and have made the necessary revisions to the manuscript. The text has been restructured to better balance the motivation and state-of-the-art analysis, the research goal has been redefined to focus on measurable outcomes, and the discussion on functional safety and operational trustworthiness has been expanded. Additionally, we have refined the language and style throughout the paper to adhere to high academic standards.

Below, we provide a point-by-point response to the reviewers’ comments, detailing the specific changes made in the revised manuscript. We hope that these revisions satisfactorily address the concerns raised and that the manuscript is now suitable for publication.

Sincerely,
The Authors

### Response to Reviewers

| Remarks of Reviewer | Comments of Author(s) | Changes | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reviewer 1** | | | |
| **1) The title should be corrected (UAV-based inspection?);** | We agree with the suggestion. The title has been corrected to more accurately reflect the methodology employed in the study. | **[Page 1, Title]** <br> The title has been changed to: **"METHOD OF UAV-BASED INSPECTION OF PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULES USING THERMAL AND RGB DATA FUSION"**. | |
| **2) Subsections 1.1 and 1.2. In our opinion, subsection 1.1 partially covers SotA analysis. The purpose of these subsections is different, so it is necessary to work out (balance) their content.** | We acknowledge that some content regarding the challenges of current inspection methods (SotA) was misplaced in the Motivation section. We have restructured these subsections to clearly separate the economic/operational drivers (Motivation) from the technical and scientific context (State of the Art). | **[Pages 2-3, Sections 1.1 & 1.2]** <br> Content related to the technical limitations of palette bias, image overlap, and data redundancy has been moved from Section 1.1 to the beginning of **Section 1.2 (State of the art)**. Section 1.1 now focuses strictly on the economic necessity of PV maintenance. | Tag **[R1-C2]** marks the beginning of the reorganized SotA section. |
| **3) Authors write, "The goal of this study is to build..." In our opinion, the goal should define a measured effect that can be achieved... Further, this goal should be traced to the Discussion/Conclusion sections.** | We agree that the goal should be quantifiable. We have rewritten the goal statement to emphasize measurable improvements in detection accuracy (mAP), recall, false positive reduction, and bandwidth efficiency. We have also ensured this goal is explicitly revisited in the Conclusion. | **[Page 1, Abstract]** <br> The goal is now defined as enhancing accuracy and efficiency by systematically increasing mAP and reducing false positives. <br> **[Page 4, Introduction]** <br> A specific paragraph detailing the measurable objectives has been added. <br> **[Page 16, Conclusions]** <br> The conclusion now begins by confirming the achievement of these specific goals: *"This study successfully validated... achieving the stated goal of enhancing detection fidelity while optimizing bandwidth."* | Tags **[R1-C3]** indicate the revised goal formulation in the Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusions. |
| **4) What about discussion of any limitation of UAV application in terms of functional safety?** | This is a valid point. While our work focuses on the logical inspection pipeline, physical safety is paramount. We have added a discussion acknowledging the limitations regarding autonomous flight near energized infrastructure and the need for collision avoidance systems. | **[Page 16, Section 4.3]** <br> A new paragraph has been added discussing functional safety risks (battery reliability, flight over infrastructure) and the necessity of integrating the proposed method with certified safety systems (IEC 62443). | Tag **[R1-C4]** marks the added discussion on functional safety. |
| **5) The main contribution and particularities of the scientific results have to be described more widely to clarify "universal" theoretical and methodical novelty.** | We have expanded the description of the scientific novelty, specifically clarifying that the "universality" stems from the palette-invariant embedding strategy, which mathematically enforces consistency across sensor variations without ad-hoc retraining. | **[Page 4, Introduction]** <br> The specific scientific novelty regarding the palette-invariant feature embedding strategy has been articulated. <br> **[Page 16, Conclusions]** <br> The conclusion reiterates this contribution as the primary scientific novelty of the results. | Tags **[R1-C5]** indicate the clarified description of scientific novelty. |
| **Reviewer 2** | | | |
| **- Authors mention Explainable AI (XAI) when discussing SotA (subsection 1.2). However, in the main part of the article, specific characteristics of AI, such as explainability, trustworthiness, etc., are not analyzed.** | We appreciate this observation. We have clarified that while we do not use gradient-based XAI maps, our system provides "operational explainability" through the active perception loop, which generates visual evidence for verification, thereby enhancing trustworthiness. | **[Page 3, Section 1.2]** <br> We clarified the distinction between internal saliency maps and our approach to trustworthiness. <br> **[Page 15, Section 4.2]** <br> A paragraph was added explaining how the re-acquisition loop enhances operator trustworthiness through "operational explainability." | Tags **[R2-C1]** indicate the added analysis of trustworthiness and XAI context. |
| **- There are crossings in subsection 4.4 and the text of section 5 (future research…).** | We agree that there was redundancy. We have removed the separate Subsection 4.4 and integrated the unique points regarding future research directions into Section 5 to create a cohesive conclusion. | **[Page 16, Section 5]** <br> Subsection 4.4 has been removed. The content regarding SCADA integration and predictive maintenance has been merged into **Section 5 (Conclusions and future work)**. | Tag **[R2-C2]** marks the consolidated future work section. |
| **- English must be improved (style with many "we" and "our" is not perfect).** | We have reviewed the manuscript and revised the language to adopt a more impersonal, passive academic voice, minimizing the use of first-person pronouns. | **[Throughout Manuscript]** <br> Phrases like *"The Methods used are..."* have been changed to *"The methods employed include..."*. <br> *"We formally define..."* has been changed to *"The problem statement is formally defined as..."*. <br> *"Our adaptive controller..."* has been changed to *"The proposed adaptive controller..."*. | Tag **[R2-C3]** in the Abstract and Section 2 highlights examples of these stylistic improvements. |
