\section{Results}
We evaluate the proposed system on two public benchmarks: \textbf{PVF-10} (UAV thermal infrared, 10 fine-grained PV fault classes) and \textbf{STHS-277} (snail-trails/hotspots; 277 thermographic images with logs). Unless noted, we use 80/10/10 train/val/test splits with identical random seeds across methods; metrics follow common practice~\cite{rainio2024srep}: mAP@0.5, mAP@[.5:.95], macro-$F_1$, recall, and the fraction of false positives caused by duplicates across overlapping frames (``Dup-FP'').

\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}
All models are trained under the same schedule and augmentations as the baselines. Thermal crops are normalized to temperature, rendered with $M{=}4$ palettes (ironbow, whitehot, rainbow, sepia), and processed by a shared encoder with the palette-invariance loss (see Methods). The fused detector runs in anchor-free mode and applies non-maximum suppression. For fairness, single-modality baselines use the same backbone and training budget. For geo de-duplication we map detections to WGS84 and cluster with DBSCAN over the haversine metric with $\varepsilon{=}1.0$~m and $\texttt{minPts}{=}2$.

\subsection{Overall Accuracy}
Table~\ref{tab:overall} summarizes the main results. On \textbf{PVF-10}, the proposed multi-palette Thermal+RGB fusion reaches $\text{mAP@0.5}=0.903$ and mAP@[.5:.95]$=0.598$, a gain of $+14.3$ points over the average of thermal-only and RGB-only baselines. On \textbf{STHS-277}, the fused model achieves $\text{mAP@0.5}=0.887$ and mAP@[.5:.95]$=0.571$, an improvement of $+13.2$ points over the same average. Precision–recall curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:pr_curves} show consistent lifts across operating points.

\paragraph{Uncertainty and significance.}
Across three seeds, the fused model attains $\text{mAP@0.5}=0.903\,[0.895,0.911]$ on PVF-10 and $0.887\,[0.865,0.910]$ on STHS-277 (95\% bootstrap CI over images). A paired bootstrap test between the fused model and the best single-modality baseline rejects the null of equal performance at $p<0.01$ on both datasets.

\subsection{Ablations: palette invariance and re-acquisition}
Table~\ref{tab:ablation} and Fig.~\ref{fig:ablate} quantify contributions on PVF-10. Moving from single-modality to naive T+RGB already helps ($+6.6$ points mAP@0.5). Enforcing palette invariance adds another $+4.6$ points and improves small-target recall from $0.80$ to $0.84$. The adaptive gimbal re-acquisition further raises small-target recall to $0.86$ while adding $+1.1$ points mAP@0.5.

\subsection{Geo de-duplication: fewer redundant alarms}
Across both datasets, geo de-duplication reduces duplicate-induced false positives by $15$--$20$\% absolute (Fig.~\ref{fig:dedup}). On PVF-10, Dup-FP drops from $0.24$ to $0.07$; on STHS-277, from $0.20$ to $0.05$. A sensitivity sweep in Table~\ref{tab:dbscan} indicates that $\varepsilon{=}1.0$~m minimizes duplicates without over-merging.

\subsection{Robustness to flight envelope}
Following the capture study in the technical report, we profiled altitude and speed. Accuracy peaks at 5--10~m and degrades by $9$--$14$\% when flying at 15~m due to reduced ground sampling distance (Fig.~\ref{fig:envelope}). Speeds above 5~m/s lead to motion blur and a $-6$ point mAP drop at 10~m/s. Quantitative summaries are provided in Table~\ref{tab:flight}.

\subsection{Per-class behavior on PVF-10}
While improvements are uniform, gains are largest on classes with subtle thermal contrast. Fig.~\ref{fig:perclass} plots AP@0.5 by class (anonymized C1--C10); palette-aware fusion consistently outperforms each baseline.

\subsection{Bandwidth impact}
Transmitting only confirmed, geo-de-duplicated detections reduces average telemetry from $14.5$~MB/min to $5.4$~MB/min on PVF-10 (−$63$\%) and from $13.2$~MB/min to $4.3$~MB/min on STHS-277 (−$67$\%), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bandwidth}. JSON/KML exemplars are provided in the supplementary payloads.

\subsection{Comparison with prior work}
Table~\ref{tab:sota} contrasts our system with representative detectors re-trained under the same budget. Palette-aware fusion reaches higher accuracy while sustaining the fastest embedded throughput among the compared models.
