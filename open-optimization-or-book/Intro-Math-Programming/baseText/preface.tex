\end{center}

I would like to acknowledge that substantial parts of this book were borrowed under a CC-BY-SA license.   These substantial pieces include:
\begin{itemize}
\item "A First Course in Linear Algebra" by Lyryx Learning (based on original text by Ken Kuttler).   A majority of their formatting was used along with selected sections that make up the appendix sections on linear algebra. We are extremely grateful to Lyryx for sharing their files with us.  They do an amazing job compiling their books and the templates and formatting that we have borrowed here clearly took a lot of work to set up.  Thank you for sharing all of this material to make structuring and formating this book much easier! See subsequent page for list of contributors.
\item "Foundations of Applied Mathmatics" with many contributors.  See \url{https://github.com/Foundations-of-Applied-Mathematics}.  Several sections from these notes were used along with some formatting.  Some of this content has been edited or rearranged to suit the needs of this book.  This content comes with some great references to code and nice formatting to present code within the book.   See subsequent page with list of contributors.
\item "Linear Inequalities and Linear Programming" by 
Kevin Cheung.  See \url{https://github.com/dataopt/lineqlpbook}.  These notes are posted on GitHub in a ".Rmd" format for nice reading online.  This content was converted to \LaTeX using Pandoc.    These notes make up a substantial section of the Linear Programming part of this book.
\item Linear Programming notes by Douglas Bish.  These notes also make up a substantial section of the Linear Programming part of this book.
\end{itemize}

I would also like to acknowledge Laurent Porrier and Diego Moran for contributing various notes on linear and integer programming.   

I would also like to thank Jamie Fravel for helping to edit this book and for contributing chapters, examples, and code.
