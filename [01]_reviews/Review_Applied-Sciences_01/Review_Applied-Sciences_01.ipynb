      "Abstract: The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming education,    11 with tools like ChatGPT enhancing learning, content creation, and academic support. This    12 study analyzes ChatGPT's acceptance among Costa Rican university students using the 13 UTAUT2 model and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The    14 research examines key predictors of AI adoption, including performance expectancy, ef15 fort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, behavioral intention, and actual 16 usage. Data from 194 students reveal that performance expectancy is the strongest predic17 tor of behavioral intention, followed by effort expectancy, while social influence and fa18 cilitating conditions play a minor role. Behavioral intention significantly influences actual 19 usage. Differences emerge based on gender and age, with male students and those aged    20 21-30 showing higher acceptance levels. Despite positive attitudes toward ChatGPT, stu21 dents report a lack of sufficient training for its effective use. These findings highlight the 22 need for tailored pedagogical strategies to ensure meaningful AI integration into educa23 tion. The study suggests further research on AI training programs and their long-term    24 impact on academic performance, emphasizing the importance of fostering digital literacy    25 for a more effective and responsible adoption of generative AI in higher education. 26\n",

      "The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the educational field is 30 having a significant impact on teaching practices and students' learning processes. This type of artificial intelligence is characterized by its ability to process natural human language and generate content in various formats, such as text, images, and audio. As [1] (p.    33 2)  points  out,  \"generative  models process a large corpus of complex and unstructured data, such as texts, audio, or images, to then generate new content in the same style as the original data.\" Similarly, [2] (p. 7) states that \"it refers to a distinct class of artificial intelligence that uses deep learning models to generate human-like content, such as images or    37 words, in response to complex and varied instructions.\" This content can be produced in a wide variety of formats (video, text, audio, etc.) and serve different functions (assigning labels  to  images,  clustering  data -such as identifying customer segments with similar    40 purchasing behaviors -or selecting actions) [3].\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of GenAI in educational contexts has been facilitated by the accessibility of 42 tools based on advanced language models, whose intuitive interface allows interactions    43 through natural language. However, this ease of use does not imply that its educational    44 application is automatically effective. As UNESCO [4] warns, the effective use of these    45 tools requires specific training in both query formulation and the interpretation and refi46 nement of generated responses. In this regard, a transition in the application of technology 47 in teaching is observed: from a model focused on learning \"from\" technology, where it is 48 perceived merely as a channel for transmitting information and assessment, to a paradigm    49 of learning \"with\" technology, where its use is enhanced as a cognitive tool for knowledge    50 construction [5]. 51\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its growing incorporation into education, the implementation of GenAI pre52 sents various challenges and limitations. Among these, the accuracy and validity of gene53 rated information, ethical responsibility in its use, the need for curricular adaptation, the 54 redefinition of teaching and student roles, and the presence of inherent biases in AI mo55 dels stand out. Additionally, aspects such as randomness in responses, dependence on    56 these tools, the need for specific training to critically evaluate their results, and implica57 tions for data privacy and security must be considered [6, 7, 8]. In this last aspect, there    58 are two major models: in one, control is held by companies, as seen in the United States, 59 while in the other, control is exercised by the state, as in China. 60\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the most widely used GenAI tools in the educational environment are Ope61 nAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Deepseek by Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelli62 gence Basic Technology Research, and Google's Gemini. These platforms offer a wide    63 range of functionalities, including text generation, image creation, document translation, 64 summarization and evaluation rubrics, key idea identification, case correction, assistance 65 in computer programming, and information synthesis, among others. This versatility has    66 made GenAI an attractive resource for integration into teaching, transforming traditional 67 teaching and learning methodologies [9, 10] 68\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in the use of GenAI in education has led to an increase in research on its 69 pedagogical applications and has driven meta-analyses on its impact in various educatio70 nal contexts [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. These systematic reviews have identified key trends, such 71 as the predominance of studies focused on higher education, the concentration of research 72 in developed countries, teachers' concerns about ethical aspects, the interest in analyzing 73 students' practices with these tools, the recognition of their potential for adaptive learning, 74 and the identification of a widespread need for training in their use. Additionally, both 75 teachers and students express a positive attitude toward the incorporation of GenAI in    76 teaching, provided that its use is carried out critically and reflectively [16, 17]. 77\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude this section, it is worth highlighting Robert &amp; Muscanell [18] in their    78 Horizon Report for Educause: '… generative artificial intelligence emerged as the fastest -79 adopted technology in history. All members of the higher education community, from    80 students to administrators, are trying to determine what impact generative AI tools can, 81 will, and should have on life, learning, and work.' [18] (p. 3). 82\n",

      "## 2. Students and ChatGPT\n",

      "83\n",
      "\n",
      "In this regard, artificial intelligence (AI) represents a field of particular interest, given 84 its exponential growth and increasing integration into teaching and learning processes. 85 Exploring students' attitudes and level of acceptance toward this technology in general, 86 and ChatGPT in particular, not only helps to understand their disposition toward these    87 technologies but is also essential for identifying necessary changes in AI education, the 88 measures that should be adopted to optimize their training in this field, and the possibil89 ities that, according to students, these technologies have for their incorporation into their 90 educational activities. 91\n",
      "\n",
      "The incorporation of AI into education has been carried out under three paradigms:    92 AI-directed, where the student is a recipient; AI-supported, where the student is a collab93 orator; and AI-empowered, where the student is a leader. In these three paradigms, AI    94 techniques are used to address educational and learning problems in different ways. AI 95 is used to represent knowledge models and guide cognitive learning while students act    96 as recipients of AI services in Paradigm One; AI is used to support learning while students 97 collaborate with AI in Paradigm Two; AI is used to empower learning while students take    98 the initiative to learn in Paradigm Three [19]. 99\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous studies have shown that students exhibit positive attitudes and strong    100 interest in the possibilities AI offers for their education, as well as an increasing willing101 ness to integrate these tools into their learning [20, 21, 16, 22, 23]. 102\n",
      "\n",
      "However, research results have sometimes been contradictory. Some studies indicate    103 that AI use decreases students' academic performance [24], although this may be due to    104 poor pedagogical planning by teachers or the unrestricted use of these tools by students 105 without proper guidance. Nevertheless, studies showing positive performance outcomes    106 outnumber those indicating negative results [25, 26]. 107\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, research based on the application of the UTAUT model has highlighted    108 that factors such as hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and 109 social influence are key predictors of students' intention to use ChatGPT. In this regard,    110 [27] found that behavioral intention and facilitating conditions significantly influence the 111 actual use of this tool. Similar findings were reported by [28], who observed that usage    112 behavior  has  the  most  significant  impact  on  behavioral  intention,  followed  by  perfor113 mance  expectancy  and  hedonic  motivation.  Additionally,  behavioral  intention  signifi114 cantly influences actual usage, being modulated by habit and facilitating conditions. 115\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, although students exhibit a high acceptance of AI in general and ChatGPT in    116 particular, they also acknowledge insufficient training for its effective use [20, 29]. In this 117 regard, various studies have pointed out that students demand greater training in this    118 field, emphasizing the need for structured and specific education on the use of AI in edu119 cational contexts [21]. These demands highlight the importance of designing educational    120 strategies that enable the effective pedagogical integration of AI, ensuring that students 121 acquire the necessary competencies for its critical and reflective use in academic settings. 122\n",
