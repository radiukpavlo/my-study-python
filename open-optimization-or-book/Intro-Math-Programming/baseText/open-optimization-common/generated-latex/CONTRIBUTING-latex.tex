\hypertarget{latex}{%
\subsubsection{LaTeX}\label{latex}}

Our primary goal is to produce a book in PDF format. We use PDFLaTeX.

We will consider other targets, such as generating HTML, later.

\hypertarget{including-material-prepared-in-markdown-in-latex-documents}{%
\paragraph{Including material prepared in Markdown in LaTeX
documents}\label{including-material-prepared-in-markdown-in-latex-documents}}

We avoid the markdown package
(https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Writing\_Markdown\_in\_LaTeX\_Documents)
(it requires \textbackslash{}write18 or lualatex) and instead generate
.tex by pandoc.
