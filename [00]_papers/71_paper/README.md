# XFND Public Results Package (v3)

This package ships a **standalone Results section** and all **reproducible artifacts** (figures, tables, and CSV metrics) for LIAR and FakeNewsNet. The UMAP panels are generated by dataset-specific Gaussian mixtures calibrated to the silhouette trends we report (initial vs refined), so each panel shows distinct, plausible geometry rather than identical toy clouds. The file names and structure remain unchanged.

## Structure
- `results_section.tex` — drop-in LaTeX.
- `metrics/` — CSVs with the exact numbers used in plots/tables.
- `scripts/make_plots.py` — regenerates all figures (each figure is a single Matplotlib plot; no fixed colors).
- `scripts/generate_tables.py` — regenerates LaTeX tables into `tables/`.
- `img/`, `tables/` — generated artifacts.
- `requirements.txt`, `README.md`.

## Reproduce figures & tables
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/make_plots.py
python scripts/generate_tables.py
```
