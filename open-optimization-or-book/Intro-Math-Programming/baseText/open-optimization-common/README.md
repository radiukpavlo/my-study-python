# About Open Optimization

- Open education resources
- Commercial use is allowed - discuss why this choice is made.
- "Code" MIT license - for code examples...

Welcome to Open Optimization - an ecosystem for open-source materials for teaching optimization and operations research.  This ecosystem is being formed to host open-source lecture notes, lecture slides, examples, code, figures, and textbooks on material and courses related to optimization.

All material other than code will be licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) that permits free reuse and alteration of the material provided the proper attribution is given.  All material posted will be not just open-source, but open-source code as well - including LaTeX, tikz, and other means of generating content.  This allows those interested in reusing material an easy way to change and adapt the material as needed.

All code (e.g., Julia, Python, AMPL, GAMS, MatLab, etc.) on this repository will be licensed freely under the MIT License.  This is in an effort to make code simple and easy to reuse.

Your contributions to this endeavor are greatly valued and appreciated.  We hope you will help with this project and also use it as a resource for future courses, lectures, and presentations.

Content posted here may be adapted into freely available open-source textbooks published through ???.  All contributors will be named in the acknowledgments section of any final publication unless they request to be removed. This attribution will include their name and institutional affiliation, and link to a profile or other professional site of their choosing.    Please see ____ as an example.

## Goals:
- Create freely available content to make easier teaching, designing courses, writing presentations, and finding reusable content.
- Create free textbooks for courses on optimization and operations research that are
- Modern (up to date with current techniques and approaches)
- Flexible (easy to adapt to the user’s choice of presentation of material)
- Direct access to code examples (get students up and running faster)
- Community collaboration on content authoring and revisions
- Collect figures and images with source code for quality reproducibility
- Host instructive code for optimization



# Memorandum of Understanding: Open Optimization
Open Optimization is a collaborative project, aimed at creating a quality open textbook/open resource for university courses in optimization, operations research, and related courses. This project will host open-source lecture notes, lecture slides, examples, code, figures, and textbooks.  All materials will be accompanied by source code (.tex, .tikz, etc) for easy generation and adaptation.  The project goals are to:
- Create freely available content to make easier teaching, designing courses, writing presentations, and finding reusable content.
- Create free textbooks for courses on optimization and operations research that are
- Modern (up to date with current techniques and approaches)
- Flexible (easy to adapt to the user’s choice of presentation of material)
- Direct access to code examples (get students up and running faster)
- Foster community collaboration on content authoring and revisions
- Collect figures and images with source code for quality reproducibility
- Host instructive code


This memorandum of understanding (MOU) lays out the contributor expectations, licensing information, and other conditions of participation. All contributors are asked to read through and agree to the terms. Any questions or concerns can be addressed to the project manager: Robert Hildebrand - rhil@vt.edu.

In accordance, all authors and other creators retain the copyright to their contributions, and by signing below, grant a MIT License to all code created for this project.

## Edits, updates, and revisions
All team members understand and accept that the content they produce in the context of this project may be edited, updated, reviewed, and otherwise altered over the course of the ongoing project. Authors/creators will have the opportunity to address significant recommended changes or additions following peer review and/or developmental editing and retain the right to remove their name from the published version at any time.

## Team participation
All participants are expected to be engaged, respectful team members. This includes:
Participating in project discussions, decision-making processes, team calls/webinars, and other activities as requested
Ensuring you meet agreed all upon deadlines, or offer as much notice as possible if you require an extension. If for any reason you need to pull out of the project, this should also be indicated to the admin team promptly
Participating in promotional activities and actively leveraging your own network wherever possible to attract contributors and adopters
Treating all members of the team with respect, in words and actions
Engaging with and furthering the project goals

## Recognition for contributors
All contributors will be named in the acknowledgments section of any resulting publication unless they request to be removed. This attribution will include their name and institutional affiliation, and link to a profile or other professional site of their choosing.

## Termination
The project admin team reserves the right to terminate participation in the project at any time if a contributor is:
Not fulfilling their agreed-upon obligations in a timely manner
Failing to treat other members of the team with respect
Otherwise disrupting or negatively impacting the success of the project and team

If a team member is asked to leave the project, any submitted work may be retained and completed/expanded by another contributor in accordance with the conditions of the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
